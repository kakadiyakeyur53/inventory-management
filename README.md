# How I Built My First MERN App in a Week

This repository contains the code for a web application I created using the MERN tech stack. I created a simple inventory management system.

I wrote an article that talks about the resources I used, problems I faced, and criticisms [here](https://medium.com/dailyjs/how-i-built-my-first-mern-stack-app-in-a-week-243f04787db6).

If you want to play around with a deployed version of this web app, I have it hosted on Heroku [here](https://martinb-inventory.herokuapp.com/)
